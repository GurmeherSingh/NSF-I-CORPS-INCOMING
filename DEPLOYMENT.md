# Deployment Guide - NJIT Athlete Rehabilitation System

## Quick Start

The application is now ready to run! Here's how to get started:

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

# Initialize the database
node server/init-db.js

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

### 2. Default Login Credentials

   - Login with the default trainer credentials
   - You'll see the trainer dashboard with sample exercises

2. **Register as Athlete**:
   - Click "Sign Up" on the login page
   - Create an athlete account
   - Login to see the athlete dashboard

3. **Create Assignments** (Trainer):
   - Use the trainer dashboard to assign exercises to athletes
   - Monitor progress and compliance

4. **Log Progress** (Athlete):
   - Athletes can log their daily exercise completion
   - Track pain levels and difficulty ratings

- Progress tracking with pain/difficulty ratings
- Notifications system

### ✅ API Endpoints
- Complete REST API for all operations
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
```
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build the React frontend
npm run build

# The built files will be in client/build/
# The server will serve these files automatically
```

### Database
The application uses SQLite for simplicity. For production, consider:
- PostgreSQL or MySQL for better performance
- Database backups and replication
- Connection pooling

### Security Considerations
- Change the JWT secret in production
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Set up proper CORS policies
